## Packages
recharts | For dashboard analytics charts
framer-motion | For smooth page transitions and micro-interactions
clsx | For conditional class names
tailwind-merge | For merging tailwind classes safely

## Notes
- Tailwind Config: Ensure font-display and font-sans are set up
- Retell AI Config: The 'config' field is a JSON blob. The UI will extract common fields (voice_id, llm_id, general_prompt) for editing.
- Mock Data: Dashboard charts will use static mock data as there is no analytics endpoint in the schema yet.
